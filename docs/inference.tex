 \section{Posterior Inference over PDFAs}
 
 We   perform  posterior   inference  by   sampling   assignments  for
 $\delta_{ij}$ individually.  Rather  than ordinary Gibbs sampling, we
 use a  mixed Gibbs/Metropolis-Hastings update.  To  see why, consider
 the  following case:  $\delta_{ij}$ is  the only  sampled  element of
 $\delta$ that  is assigned  to the state  $q_{i'}$.  When  we removed
 $\delta_{ij}$  from  the counts  to  sample  it,  the probability  of
 assigning  it  back to  $q_{i'}$  becomes zero,  and  even  if it  is
 assigned  to   some  new   state  $q_{i''}$,  the   probability  that
 $\delta_{i'j} =  \delta_{i''j}$ for  all $j$ visited  by the  data is
 low.  We do not want to forget a good sample, so instead we propose a
 new  $\delta_{ij}$  and  accept  or  reject according  to  the  usual
 Metropolis-Hastings ratio.
 
Samples from the CRF are exchangeable, so we can remove $\delta_{ij}$
and propose a sample $\delta{ij}^*$ according to the CRF given
$\delta_{-ij}^T$, the elements of $\delta$ visited by $x_{0:T}$
excluding $\delta_{ij}$.  This is the prior probability excluding the
data, which cancels with the equivalent term in the posterior, meaning
that the accept probability $\alpha(\delta_{ij},\delta_{ij}^*)$ is
given by the ratio of the likelihood of the data

\[ \alpha(\delta_{ij},\delta_{ij}^*) =  \mathrm{min}\left(1,\frac{p(x_{0:T}|\delta_{ij}^*,\delta_{-ij}^T)}{p(x_{0:T}|\delta_{ij},\delta_{-ij}^T)}\right)\]

In general the numerator cannot be evaluated because changing
$\delta_{ij}$ means changing the entire sequence of states visited by
the data after $\delta_{ij}$ is first visited.  In practice we
estimate the numerator by Monte Carlo approximation, sampling elements
of $\delta$ according to the CRF as they are first visited by the
data.  Changing one element of $\delta$ means many already-sampled
state/symbol pairs may never be visited by the data, and have no
effect on the likelihood.  The posterior probability of any value for
these elements of $\delta$ is the same as the prior, and therefore we
may remove them from $\delta^T$ after accepting a new $\delta_{ij}$.
